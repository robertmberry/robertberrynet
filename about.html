						<h1><em>Summary</em></h1>
						<p>I am an experienced grant writer and sales professional helping organizations improve their bottom line. I help non-profit organizations, art galleries, and businesses sell more artworks in-store and online, help them increase their overall revenues through grants and donations, and streamline business operations to become more efficient. I bring 15+ years of experience in art sales and operations roles, and have a successful track record selling to high-net worth individuals, increasing repeat customers, and ensuring a positive customer/client experience. Additionally, I lead email marketing campaigns, facilitate art auctions, and provide graphic design, social media management and content creation. I have also successfully secured over $1,000,000+ in grant funds on behalf of organizations.</p>
						<p>I’m currently enrolled in a full-stack web development program focusing on front end programming languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery along with back end development concepts, database design, PHP, and XML and JSON. I have a few WordPress site that I designed and manage: <a href="https://www.robertberrygallery.com" target="_blank">RobertBerryGallery.com</a>, <a href="https://www.artreviewcity.com" target="_blank">ArtReviewCity.com</a>, <a href="https://www.geigercommunications.com" target="_blank">GeigerCommunications.com</a>, <a href="https://www.robberry.org" target="_blank">RobBerry.org</a> an older HTML/CSS page I created, and an older commercial site I built on my <a href="https://robertmberry.github.io/landshark/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
						<p>I have a master's degree from Brooklyn College, and 20 years in sales, marketing, design, and IT. Over the last several years, I been consulting for the non-profit arts organization WhiteBox where I write grants, manage fundraising and benefit auctions; and oversee marketing, communications, videos, and social media. I’m currently at Chashama, founded by the Durst Organization, who partners with property owners to transform unused real estate into space for artists, and space for free art classes in under-resourced communities. At Chashama, I am researching and writing foundation, corporate, and government grants; hosting fundraising events; and increasing corporate and individual donations.</p>
						<p>Previously, I was working with skilled and masterful contemporary artists while leading influential NYC galleries promoting artists, selling contemporary and secondary art to clients; writing promotional materials; educating the public; supervising marketing, PR, and social media communications; and overseeing exhibition logistics, budgeting, and finances. Before my time in the art world, I developed an expansive repertoire of design and technical knowledge working in design and IT departments coding HTML/CSS websites and eblasts; designing product catalogs, menus, and sales brochures; spent a year at a media company developing audio/video projects; and have IT additional experience including MySQL databases, Microsoft Dynamics GP, Wordpress, networking, troubleshooting, and numerous other soft skills developed over the years.</p>
